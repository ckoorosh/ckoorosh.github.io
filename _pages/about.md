I am Mohammadreza, a senior student pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

<!-- I like investigating different aspects of **generative modeling** and **robust learning** as they align with my previous research of working with *diffusion models* and *evaluating text-guided robustness*. I also want to challenge myself in NLP further and am interested in the concept of **reasoning** and working with **multi-modality**. -->
My research interests lie in the intersection of **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. Specifically, I like investigating different aspects of **generative modeling** and **robust learning** in these fields. I am also intrigued by the concept of **reasoning** and **multi-modality**.

From 2020 to 2022, I worked as an Augmented Reality Developer at the [MadLlama](https://madllamastudio.com) game studio. I was responsible for developing mobile AR games with ARCore, ARKit and Unity.

Afterwards, I worked under the supervision of *Prof. Alahi* and the [VITA lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) at EPFL on **human motion prediction**. We proposed a novel deep generative **diffusion model** for *human motion reconstruction and prediction* from *incomplete and noisy data* that outperforms SOTA models. Our research resulted in a paper published in ICRA'23 and NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Score-Based Methods: [A generic diffusion-based approach for 3D human pose prediction in the wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05669).

Then, under the supervision of *Prof. Kortylewski* and the [GVRL lab](https://gvrl.mpi-inf.mpg.de) at MPI, I conducted research on the **robustness of image classifiers**. We proposed a novel benchmark for evaluating the robustness of image classifiers to **textâ€‘guided corruptions**. Our work was accepted to CVPR'23 Workshop on Generative Models for Computer Vision: [Benchmarking Robustness to Text-Guided Corruptions](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/GCV/html/Mofayezi_Benchmarking_Robustness_to_Text-Guided_Corruptions_CVPRW_2023_paper.html).

I am currently working on my B.Sc. thesis under the supervision of Prof. Asgari at the [LLP lab](https://llp.berkeley.edu/asgari/). We are working on efficient methods for **text-guided human face manipulation**.
